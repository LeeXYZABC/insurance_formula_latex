# insurance_formula_latex
This repository contains data for tuning/testing formula ocr models. It contains 400 samples with 80 $\actuarialangle$ samples, which are not common but extensively used in insurance formulas. These samples are collected manually when process insurance testing papers. Hope they could help others improve their ocr models.
